## 🔧 Configuration Options

Edit `config.py` to customize:

- `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token
- `AUTHORIZED_CHAT_IDS`: List of allowed user IDs
- `AGENT_MODEL`: Gemini model to use
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`: Maximum upload file size
- `DEFAULT_RECORDING_DURATION`: Default screen recording time
- `MAX_RECORDING_DURATION`: Maximum allowed recording time
- `RECORDING_FPS`: Screen recording frame rate

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:**

1. **Authorization**: Always keep `REQUIRE_AUTHORIZATION = True`
2. **Chat IDs**: Only add trusted users to `AUTHORIZED_CHAT_IDS`
3. **Bot Token**: Never share your bot token publicly
4. **Sensitive Operations**: Be cautious with:
   - File deletion
   - File encryption
   - Command execution
   - Permission changes

5. **Network**: Run on trusted networks only
6. **Monitoring**: Check bot activity logs regularly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond
- Check if the bot token is correct
- Verify your chat ID is in the authorized list
- Check internet connection
- Look for errors in the console

### Commands fail
- Verify file paths are correct
- Check file permissions
- Ensure required dependencies are installed
- Check if the current directory is accessible

### Screen recording issues
- Verify `opencv-python` and `pyautogui` are installed
- Check if screen resolution is supported
- Reduce recording duration for large files

### Import errors
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.8+)
- Try reinstalling packages

## 🔄 Auto-Start on System Boot

### Windows

1. Create a batch file `start_bot.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
cd "E:\CodingWorld\Pyhton Projects\AI-Agents\telegram-agent"
pythonw main.py
```

2. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter
3. Copy `start_bot.bat` to the Startup folder

### Linux (systemd)

1. Create a service file `/etc/systemd/system/telegram-agent.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Telegram System Agent
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/telegram-agent
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 main.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

2. Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable telegram-agent
sudo systemctl start telegram-agent
```
